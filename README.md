This project is a simple GUI-based calculator built using Tkinter in Python. It initializes a Tkinter window with a title and fixed size, featuring an entry box to display user input and results. Numeric buttons (0-9) allow input, while operator buttons (+, -, *, /) handle arithmetic operations. The equal button (=) computes and displays the result. Additional functionalities include "AC" to clear input, "Backspace" to remove the last digit, and a "Power Off" button that asks for confirmation before exiting. Event handling functions process button clicks and perform calculations, while window.mainloop() keeps the application running.
